# GRE Words

A chrome extension that shows words along with their meanings instead of posts in Facebook feed.

## Installation Instructions

The extention can be installed from [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gre-fb-news-feed/hbhdccjdfjcpakliojfnpincocolhcob).

If you would like to modify the extention (maybe change the number or words shown/modify the word list), you can clone the repo and make changes in `kill.js`. You can then load it directly by enabling Developer mode in `chrome://extensions/` and loading the unpacked extention directly from file system. 

## TODO
- Port the extension to firefox.
